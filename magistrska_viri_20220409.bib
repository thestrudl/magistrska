	shorttitle = {{WireGuard}},
	abstract = {{WireGuard} is a secure network tunnel, operating at layer 3, implemented as a kernel virtual network interface for Linux, which aims to replace both {IPsec} for most use cases, as well as popular user space and/or {TLS}-based solutions like {OpenVPN}, while being more secure, more performant, and easier to use. The virtual tunnel interface is based on a proposed fundamental principle of secure tunnels: an association between a peer public key and a tunnel source {IP} address. It uses a single round trip key exchange, based on {NoiseIK}, and handles all session creation transparently to the user using a novel timer state machine mechanism. Short pre-shared static keys—Curve25519 points—are used for mutual authentication in the style of {OpenSSH}. The protocol provides strong perfect forward secrecy in addition to a high degree of identity hiding. Transport speed is accomplished using {ChaCha}20Poly1305 authenticated-encryption for encapsulation of packets in {UDP}. An improved take on {IP}-binding cookies is used for mitigating denial of service attacks, improving greatly on {IKEv}2 and {DTLS}’s cookie mechanisms to add encryption and authentication. The overall design allows for allocating no resources in response to received packets, and from a systems perspective, there are multiple interesting Linux implementation techniques for queues and parallelism. Finally, {WireGuard} can be simply implemented for Linux in less than 4,000 lines of code, making it easily audited and veriﬁed.},

	abstract = {{OpenVPN} is a virtual private network ({VPN}) system that implements techniques to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It implements both client and server applications.
{OpenVPN} allows peers to authenticate each other using pre-shared secret keys, certificates or username/password. When used in a multiclient-server configuration, it allows the server to release an authentication certificate for every client, using signatures and certificate authority.
It uses the {OpenSSL} encryption library extensively, as well as the {TLS} protocol, and contains many security and control features. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes {SSL}/{TLS} for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network address translators ({NATs}) and firewalls.
{OpenVPN} has been ported and embedded to several systems. For example, {DD}-{WRT} has the {OpenVPN} server function. {SoftEther} {VPN}, a multi-protocol {VPN} server, also has an implementation of {OpenVPN} protocol.

Most of the instruction set has been standardized and several hardware implementations are commercially available. In this paper we highlight features of {RISC}-V that are interesting for optimizing implementations of cryptographic primitives. We provide the first optimized assembly implementations of table-based {AES}, bitsliced {AES}, {ChaCha}, and the Keccak-\$\$f\$\$f[1600] permutation for the {RV}32I instruction set. With respect to public-key cryptography, we study the performance of arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic without a carry flag. We then estimate the improvement that can be gained by several {RISC}-V extensions. These performance studies also serve to aid design choices for future {RISC}-V extensions and implementations.},

	abstract = {In energy meteorology research, scientists from several domains such as physics, meteorology and electrical engineering work together to obtain information needed to characterize energy production from regenerative energy sources such as wind and solar power. For this purpose, several scientiﬁc applications were developed to process large data sets from heterogenous data sources in complex and sometimes long-running process chains. In our project {WISENT} a Grid infrastructure is created to speed up execution of these applications and to ease access to computational and data resources. To achieve this goal, Grid software such as Globus Toolkit and Condor is employed to connect the existing resources of each project partner. But this ongoing process is hindered by blocking ﬁrewalls due to strong security policies and by the use of network address translation ({NAT}). In this paper we describe the current Grid architecture and focus on problems that occurred due to the use of ﬁrewalls and {NAT}. We contribute our present solutions and also discuss alternative solution ideas. One solution using the so-called “hole punching” technology is described in more detail.},

	abstract = {Network security becomes a major consideration of the current era. Internet provides an enormous ease in almost all the regions like online banking, online shopping, communications, businesses or organisations. Thus, the communication network requires the security of the confidential data stored or transfer over the internet. Due to the quick development of computerized gadgets and their entrance to the internet caused insecurity to user data. Now a days, security and privacy threats has become more and more complicated which amplify the requirement for a modernized protected medium to secure the valuable data into the internet. In this paper, introduced Virtual Private Network ({VPN}) is a great way to protect devices and information from the hackers. {VPN} is a private network which operates over a public network transit the encrypted information so that attackers are not able to use it. The purpose of {VPN} is to provide the different security elements such as authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity that’s why these are becoming trendy, low-priced and easy to use. {VPN} services are available for smart phones, computers and tablets. This paper also concerns about the development, protocols, tunnelling and security of {VPN}. It is a rising technology which plays a major role in {WLAN} by providing secure data transmission over Internet.},
